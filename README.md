I'm Jamie Martin. https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcmexplains/

I've taught English at a community college for the past ten years, and here are some projects I've worked on:

- [Writing for Success 2023](https://www.jcmexplains.com/textbook.html) is is a textbook for developmental writing.
- [JCMexplains](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiNc0N_kLpolTjdJo7HQXQ) is my YouTube channel, where I post how-to videos.
